# Stencylpedia

Stencylpedia is the official manual for [Stencyl](http://www.stencyl.com). We are in the process of migrating all of the raw content for Stencylpedia to Github in order to open it up for user edits and translations. We think this approach is safer and more effective than hosting a Wiki.

Articles are composed using [Markdown](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet), the same markup language that Github and many other sites use for creating documents.

##Editing Articles

To edit an article, visit the article on Stencylpedia and click the "Edit Article" button at the bottom. This will bring you directly to the edit page for the corresponding file on Github. Make your edits and submit as a pull request, which we have to approve before it officially makes it in. That's it!
