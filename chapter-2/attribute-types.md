Earlier in this chapter, [you learned about Attributes](https://www.stencyl.com/help/view/attributes/), which are changeable and configurable properties of Behaviors. What kinds of Attributes are at your disposal?

## What do the attribute configurators look like?

## Gotchas

Something you might bump into fairly early on is shown in the following image:

![Cannot configure](https://static.stencyl.com/pedia2/ch4/customize/image05.png)

Why are some Attributes unconfigurable?

* There's nothing to configure, or the configurator would be of limited value. (e.g. Image Instance, Shader)
* It's an Actor behavior, so until the actor's actually inside a scene, there's no context for being able to pick out a specific (Actor or Region)

For the latter case, this can be addressed by [customizing the Actor](https://www.stencyl.com/help/viewArticle/117/) once it's inside a scene.
