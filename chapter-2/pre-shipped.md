## What are Pre-Shipped Behaviors?

Stencyl includes several dozen of the most common and useful behaviors. Why? Because it's no fun reinventing the wheel or foraging around on StencylForge when you could get the "real" thing out of the box.

To find them, just begin attaching a behavior to an Actor or Scene like you'd normally do. 

Then, pick something from the **FROM YOUR LIBRARY** section.
