You'll often be asked to "Generate Logs" if you post up a bug report or ask for help.


## How to Generate Logs

Go to this menu item. Once you run it, it'll save a file on your computer that you must attach to your forum post.

## Why are logs useful?

* The error reports tell us exactly where in the code things died.
* Veterans can identify problems they've seen in the past.
* We can roughly trace what you did along the way.
