## Part 5: Importing Sounds

Step 30: Now it’s time to import our music and sound files. This time we’re going to show you a different way to import assets, by dragging
and dropping files. First, click on the Dashboard and then on Sounds.

![Dashboard](https://static.stencyl.com/pedia2/ch1/cc2/image63.png)

Step 31: With the sound files on your desktop (General Space Shooter Spacey Level.mp3 and Explosion.mp3), click on General Space Shooter.mp3 and drag it over 
into the dotted line box (shown below).

Now repeat the step and import the Explosion.mp3

Step 32: Now you’ll have two sounds. Make sure each sound is set to the correct type, as shown (the General Space Shooter Spacey Level should be set to Music, 
and the Explosion should be set to Sound Effect).

> The difference between music or sound affect:  Stencyl supports two kinds of sounds: music and sound effects. **Music** is streamed (like viewing a YouTube video) since it’s too large to fit into memory. This is best for background music. This incurs a small performance penalty on mobile devices. **Sound Effects** are loaded into memory to reduce latency in playback. This is better for short clips that need to be played immediately but consumes memory, particularly on mobile devices.

With all our assets in place, it’s time to set up the Scene that will function as our main level.
