## Introduction
Welcome to Stencyl’s Crash Course 2. The first Crash Course helped you learn the basics, and this follow-up lesson will give you a quick intro to Stencyl's Design Mode (the block builder) and show you how to build a simple game.

The game you’ll build will be a simplified version of the classic game Space Invaders, where the player controls a spaceship and shoots enemies that are floating at the top of the screen.

You'll get a dialog that allows you to name your game and set the game screen's Width and Height. Name your game Invaders and leave the Width at 640 pixels and the Height at 480 pixels.
