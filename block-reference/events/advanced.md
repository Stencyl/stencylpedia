A [Custom Event](http://www.stencyl.com/help/view/custom-events/) is an event that can be called from this behavior (using the `trigger event` block), or as a response to messages that get sent by other behaviors (using one of the `trigger event ... in ...` blocks). The former is like a function call. The latter is different from function calls since sending out a message doesn't specify a recipient, so multiple recipients could exist.

Not an event. Lets you insert arbitrary code into your behavior at the "class" level. You could use this to define functions or add class-level fields, for example. Use code blocks within this wrapper.
