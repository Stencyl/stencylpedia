A [Custom Event](https://www.stencyl.com/help/view/custom-events/) is an event that can be called from this behavior (using the `trigger event` block), or as a response to messages that get sent by other behaviors (using one of the `trigger event ... in ...` blocks). The former is like a function call. The latter is different from function calls since sending out a message doesn't specify a recipient, so multiple recipients could exist.
