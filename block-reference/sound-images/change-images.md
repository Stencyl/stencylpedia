## Draw on Image

drawImageOnImage([IMAGE], [IMAGE], [INT], [INT], [BLEND MODE]);
```

***

### <a name="image-draw-text"></a> Draw Text onto Image

Draws the given text (using a font) on top of the image at the specified location.

```
drawTextOnImage([IMAGE], [TEXT], [INT], [INT], [FONT]);
```

***

### <a name="image-fill"></a> Fill Image with Color

![fill image with color](https://static.stencyl.com/pedia2/block-images/sound-images/change-images/image-fill.png)

Replaces all pixels in the image with the given color.

```
fillImage([IMAGE], [COLOR]);
```

***

Creates a color from red, green, blue channels. Numbers must be between [0-255] inclusive.

```
Utils.getColorRGB([INT], [INT], [INT])
```

***

## Clear Image

### <a name="image-clear"></a> Clear Part of Image

![clear image at x int y int w int h int](https://static.stencyl.com/pedia2/block-images/sound-images/change-images/image-clear.png)

Clears out the specified part of the image by making those pixels transparent.

```
clearImagePartially([IMAGE], [INT], [INT], [INT], [INT]);
```

***

### <a name="image-clear-all"></a> Clear Whole Image

![clear image](https://static.stencyl.com/pedia2/block-images/sound-images/change-images/image-clear-all.png)

Clears out the entire image by making its pixels transparent.

```
clearImage([IMAGE]);
```

![clear image using image at x int y int](https://static.stencyl.com/pedia2/block-images/sound-images/change-images/image-mask.png)

Clears out the image using the second image as a mask. The second image will "cut out" pixels from the first. If using "retain", will do the opposite -- it will clear out all pixels except for those that are in the mask.

```
clearImageUsingMask([IMAGE], [IMAGE], [INT], [INT]);
retainImageUsingMask([IMAGE], [IMAGE], [INT], [INT]);
```

***

***

## Pixel Operations

### <a name="image-wrapper"></a> Batch Draw

![batch draw on image](https://static.stencyl.com/pedia2/block-images/sound-images/change-images/image-wrapper.png)

```
[IMAGE].lock();
[ACTIONS]
[IMAGE].unlock();
```

***
