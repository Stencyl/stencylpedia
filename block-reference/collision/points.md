### <a name="tile-data-for-collision"></a> Get Data for Collided Tile

![data for collided tile](https://static.stencyl.com/pedia2/block-images/collision/points/tile-data-for-collision.png)

Returns the text associated with the tile you collided with. Must be used within the `for each collision point...` wrapper.

> **What is this for?** You can [tag tiles](https://www.stencyl.com/help/view/tiles/) with textual data that can be accessed during game. For example, a lava tile could convey that it's deadly to the touch, or a healing tile in an RPG could heal the character passing over it. <br/> ![tile-editor](https://static.stencyl.com/pedia2/ch4/tiles/tile-metadata.png)

```
