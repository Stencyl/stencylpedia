## What is Pencyl?

Pencyl is Stencyl's built-in image editor. You can access it through Stencyl any time you need to edit an image on the fly. 

*(For example, when you're editing an actor animation frame, or a tileset frame, by pressing the Edit Image button in the lower right-hand corner)*

## Switching the Default Image Editor

Pencyl is the standard option for the image editor when you install Stencyl. You can change it to a different program (such as Photoshop), or change it back to Pencyl, by opening up the Preferences menu from the File dropdown menu.
