The Game Cleaner feature deletes resources that you're not using in your game. Specifically, it deletes resources that used to be a part of your game (you deleted them from the app), 
but for whatever reason, still exist in your game's folder.

## How to Run the Game Cleaner

The Game Cleaner is located in the app's main menu via **Debug > Game > Cleanup Unused Files...**. 

> We recommend backing up your game before using this feature.

## Notes

> This feature **DOES NOT REDUCE THE FINAL SIZE OF YOUR EXPORTED GAMES**. 

> This feature only affects the on-disk size of the game.
