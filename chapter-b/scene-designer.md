## What is the Scene Designer?

The **Scene Designer** helps you build **levels** for your game. We call these levels, **scenes**.

![Scene Designer](http://static.stencyl.com/pedia2/misc/scene-intro/index.1.jpg)


## How to Use the Scene Designer

> **Summary:** Stencyl works like Photoshop, Illustrator and other popular drawing apps.

### Selecting & Moving Objects
To select a **single** object, click on it while the Select tool is active.

![Selection Tool](http://static.stencyl.com/pedia2/misc/scene-intro/1.htm12.jpg)

To select **multiple objects**, create a box around the objects you want to select by clicking the background and dragging, or CTRL + Click every object you want to select.

Once an item is selected, you can move it or change the layer it's on. To move an item or number of selected items, click and drag it/them. To change what layer the items are on, right click them and click one of the send or bring items (arrows in the Layers pane in the bottom right section).

 
## Adding Tiles
1. Select a Tile (or several!) from the Palette.
2. Click and drag around the main area to place them.

> **Note:** To remove a tile that is already placed in the scene click on that tile and press the "**backspace**" key.

> **Tip:** To select multiple tiles at once, click and drag to draw a box around the tiles you want to select. Selected tiles are indicated by a box with a yellow border.
 

## Adding Actors
1. Select an Actor from the Palette.
2. Click to place the Actor. You can click and drag around to place multiple Actors.
 
To create an Actor on a **specific Layer**, follow these steps:

+ click on "Work on Current Layer" (button on the **left**) as Layer Mode (in the top left area of the Scene Designer **Toolbar**)
+ click on "Work only with Actors" (**black head and shoulders icon**) as Working Mode (center area of the Scene Designer **Toolbar**)
+ click on the **Layers** pane
+ click on the desired **Layer**
+ click on **Palette**
+ click on **Actors**
+ click on the desired **Actor**
+ click inside the **scene** where you want the Actor to be placed

## Erasing Actors
To erase an Actor you don't want in the scene, you can do one of two things:
1. Using the mouse:

+ click on the **Select** Tool in the vertical **Toolbar** on the left-hand side of the Scene Designer
+ click on the unwanted **Actor**
+ **right**-click > Delete

2. Using the keyboard:

+ **Select** the unwanted Actor
+ press the "**backspace**" key [<--]


## Changing Layers (for an object)

Layers determine whether an object is drawn in front of, or behind, other objects.

1. Right-click the desired object.
2. You'll see this menu. Pick the desired option.

![Layers Pane](http://static.stencyl.com/pedia2/ch4/basics/image15.png)

The **colored box** corresponds to the color used to draw the selection box (when the Select Tool is active). This lets you tell different layers apart when selecting multiple objects at a time.

The **lock** prevents edits to a layer. Click to toggle this setting.
