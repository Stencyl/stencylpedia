## What is the Scene Designer?

The **Scene Designer** helps you build **levels** for your game. We call these levels, **scenes**.

## How to Use the Scene Designer

> **Summary:** Stencyl works like Photoshop, Illustrator and other popular drawing apps.

### Selecting & Moving Objects
To select a **single** object, click on it while the Select tool is active.

![Selection Tool](https://static.stencyl.com/pedia2/misc/scene-intro/1.htm12.jpg)

To select **multiple objects**, create a box around the objects you want to select by clicking the background and dragging, or CTRL + Click every object you want to select.

Once an item is selected, you can move it by clicking and dragging it/them. If Actors are selected, you can also resize and rotate them by interacting with the small white handles on the selection box.

 
## Adding Tiles
1. Select a Tile (or several!) from the Palette.
2. Click and drag around the main area to place them.

> **Tip:** To select multiple tiles from the Palette at once, click and drag to draw a box around the tiles you want to select. Selected tiles are indicated by a box with a yellow border.
 

## Adding Actors
1. Select an Actor from the Palette.
2. Click to place the Actor. You can click and drag around to place multiple Actors.
 
To create an Actor on a **specific Layer**, follow these steps:

+ click on the **Layers** pane
+ click on the desired **Layer**
+ click on **Palette**
+ click on **Actors**
+ click on the desired **Actor**
+ click inside the **scene** where you want the Actor to be placed


## Erasing Objects
1. Select an object or group of objects in the scene.
2. Either **right-click > Delete** with the mouse, or press the "**backspace**" key [<--] with the keyboard.


## Changing Layers (for an object)

Layers determine whether an object is drawn in front of, or behind, other objects.

1. Right-click the desired object, or select multiple objects and right-click one of the objects in the selection.
2. You'll see this menu. Pick the desired option.
