## Introduction
This short, hands-on tutorial will walk you through the steps needed to create a simple platformer using pre-made content, so that you can become familiar with the main parts of Stencyl’s interface.

> Make sure you [download](http://www.stencyl.com/download/) and install **Stencyl 3.4.0** (or later) before starting the crash course. This new crash course will not work in 3.3.0 or earlier.


## Download the Crash Course Kit
This Crash Course requires the **Crash Course Kit**, which can be [downloaded here](https://github.com/Stencyl/stencylpedia/blob/master/crash-course-1/Crash%20Course%20Kit.stencyl?raw=true).


## How to Install the Crash Course Kit

#### Method 1: Drag and Drop
To **install the kit**, drag the file into Stencyl, like displayed below.

#### Method 2: Use the Menu
Alternatively, you can import it from the File menu (File > Import Game…).


## Create a New Game (Part 1 of 5)
### Welcome Center
When you open Stencyl, you’ll see a screen that looks something like this.

![Welcome Center](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Stencyl/stencylpedia/master/crash-course-1/images/crash-course-1.png)

This is the **Welcome Center**. From here, you can either create a new game or open an existing game.

### Creating a New Game
1. Click the dotted rectangle labeled **"Click here to create a Game"**.

  ![Click here to create a Game](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Stencyl/stencylpedia/master/crash-course-1/images/crash-course-2.png)

2. Click on the **Crash Course Kit**, then click the **Next button** at the bottom of the dialog.

  > **What are Kits?** Often times when you create a game in Stencyl, you’ll want to start with a Kit. A kit is a game template that comes with pre-made resources, settings and game logic. The kit you’re starting with here has all the resources you’ll need for the Crash Course.

3. Next, you’ll see a dialog pop up where you can set the game window’s size (in pixels) and name your game.

  We’re going to **name** it "Crash Course Game", though feel free to name it whatever you’d like.

  By setting the **Width** and **Height** dimensions in the **Screen Size** section, you are determining the size of the window/view that the player will see when he or she plays your game. In this case, let’s go with a Width of **640** and a Height of **480**. 

  Click the **Create** button.

4. You’ll now be taken to the **Dashboard**, a central area where you can see and open your game’s resources (actors, graphics, sounds, game logic, etc).
