This is a general FAQ for those who have general questions about Stencyl. For the most part, it doesn't cover any common troubleshooting topics.


## The Basics

#### Where can I get more help?

#### I can't launch Stencyl.

In rare cases, Stencyl may not launch at all. Often, this is due to the absence of or an unsupported version of Java.

If Java is installed and up to date, we recommend seeking help on the Stencyl forums. Be as specific as possible when seeking help!

Mac, Windows and most flavors of Linux (like Ubuntu and its derivatives).

#### Can I export iOS and Android games?

You're free to publish your game anywhere you'd like, including other portals or a personal website. Games are not locked to a single site.



## The Nitty Gritty

#### Do I need to know how to code?

Absolutely not. You can use code (Haxe, Java, Objective-C), but the vast majority of our users prefer to use our visual tools to build their game's behaviors.

#### What if I want to use code instead of the visual designer?

You can use Haxe via a built-in code editor or an external editor.

#### Are there any game graphics or sounds available with Stencyl?

Yes. Through StencylForge, our "marketplace for game resources", you can browse an extensive collection of royalty-free game graphics and sounds for your games.

#### What image format do I use with Stencyl?

Any raster format will do - PNG, JPG, and GIF. We even support animated GIFs. We don't support vector art to a satisfactory degree. It will import, but it will be converted to raster form.

#### What kind of audio files can I use?

MP3s for Flash and OGGs for everything else. It's best if these are at a 44.1kHz sampling rate with a 16-bit resolution. You can use Audacity or a similar program to change the sampling rate, if need be.
