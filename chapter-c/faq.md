This is a general FAQ for those who have general questions about Stencyl. For the most part, it doesn't cover any common troubleshooting topics.


## The Basics

#### Where can I get more help?

If Stencylpedia and Stencyl TV aren't meeting your needs, your best bet would be to ask your question on our [forums](http://community.stencyl.com/).

#### I can't launch Stencyl.

In rare cases, Stencyl may not launch at all. Often, this is due to the absence of or an unsupported version of Java.

If Java is installed and up to date, we recommend seeking help on the Stencyl forums. Be as specific as possible when seeking help!

#### Stencyl doesn't let me sign in.

You need to sign up for a free account to sign in to Stencyl and gain access to our forums, StencylForge and other services. You can do this from within Stencyl (most do this) or from our site.


## General Questions

#### What platforms is Stencyl for?

Mac, Windows and most flavors of Linux (like Ubuntu and its derivatives).

#### Can I export iOS and Android games?

Yes, we support exporting of iOS and Android games.

#### Is Stencyl free or does it cost money?

Creating Flash games is free. If you want to create mobile games or standalone games, or if you want to remove the splash screen, [those will cost money](http://www.stencyl.com/pricing/).

#### Are there different versions of Stencyl? (Flash, iOS, etc.)?

There's just one version of Stencyl. When you purchase a license, the toolset automatically unlocks that functionality. To be clear, you are always able to test your games on all platforms - you just can't publish or export until you purchase a license.

#### How do I publish games?

[Stencylpedia](http://www.stencyl.com/help/toc/) covers all aspects of game publication in the Publishing chapter. 

#### Are there any rules about where I can publish my game?

You're free to publish your game anywhere you'd like, including other portals or a personal website. Games are not locked to a single site.



## The Nitty Gritty

#### Do I need to know how to code?

Absolutely not. You can use code (Haxe, Java, Objective-C), but the vast majority of our users prefer to use our visual tools to build their game's behaviors.

#### What if I want to use code instead of the visual designer?

You can use Haxe via a built-in code editor or an external editor.

#### Are there any game graphics or sounds available with Stencyl?

Yes. Through StencylForge, our "marketplace for game resources", you can browse an extensive collection of royalty-free game graphics and sounds for your games.

#### What image format do I use with Stencyl?

Any raster format will do - PNG, JPG, and GIF. We even support animated GIFs. We don't support vector art to a satisfactory degree. It will import, but it will be converted to raster form.

#### What kind of audio files can I use?

MP3s for Flash and OGGs for everything else. It's best if these are at a 44.1kHz sampling rate with a 16-bit resolution. You can use Audacity or a similar program to change the sampling rate, if need be.
