> **Current Status**: At this time, we are not accepting translations and have temporarily taken down our online translation tool due to technical issues. All work has been preserved, and down the road, we'd like to reintroduce it.

## Check our Translation Tool (Currently Offline)

Stencyl has been partially or fully translated to quite a few languages already. Check our web-based translation tool out to check on the status of each translation and begin participating in the translation process.

## Instructions

If you're interested in translating, all you need to do is use the translation tool. Chances are good that the translation is already partially done. Your task is to fill in the missing phrases and vote existing phrases up/down. Together, you and others can collectively come up with a full transltion.

## How do make Stencyl use the latest translations?

Go to Preferences and click the Update Language Packs button. This will pull down the latest materials from the translation tool. This is only useful for those who are actively involved in translation. Regular users will pick up translations whenever they update/download Stencyl.

## Limitations

We don't support right-to-left languages such as Arabic. However, we have a partial translation to Arabic that will be useful when we're able to support it.
