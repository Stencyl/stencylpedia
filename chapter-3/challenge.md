## Chapter 3 Recap

Chapter 3 was all about Actors. You learned about...

* Animation states
* Different ways of moving Actors
* Physics
* Controlling Actors with the keyboard & mouse
* Collisions and Groups
* Tweening and Effects as ways of adding visual flair

That's quite a lot to take in.

Now that you’re familiar with these concepts, it's time to demonstrate your mastery of them by creating a game, with our help.


## Challenge: Create "Breakout"

"Breakout" is a fun, casual puzzle game that calls for quick reflexes. It uses physics, collisions, and special effects to entertain the player.

#### Your Task
Design a simple version of Breakout that includes these features:

Feature | Screenshot
--- | ---
A paddle the player can move in two directions. | ![paddle](http://static.stencyl.com/pedia2/ch3/challenge/5-0.png)
A bouncing ball you can launch from your paddle. | ![ball](http://static.stencyl.com/pedia2/ch3/challenge/7-0.png)
A short delay between ball launches. | ---
Blocks that change color and make a sound, when they collide with the ball. | ![breakout-screenshot-bouncing-ball](http://static.stencyl.com/pedia2/ch3/challenge/image11.png)

## Start with this Project
To help you get started, we’ve created a basic Kit with graphics, sounds, and a Scene to get you started and so you don't need to import any game resources. Just write the logic.

> **Instructions:** Import this using File > Import.

> **NOTICE (October 2015):** The project does not open up in any recent version of Stencyl. We plan to fix this up, but this will take time and is low on our priority list. For the moment, we'd like to focus on updating the rest of Stencylpedia first.


## Stuck? Want some hints?

* **Hint 1** - The ball shouldn't move the paddle when they collide. Look at each Actor Type's [Physics](http://www.stencyl.com/help/view/working-with-physics/) settings.

* **Hint 2** - You'll need a Behavior to keep your paddle from disappearing off screen.
