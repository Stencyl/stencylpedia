## Chapter 3 Recap

Chapter 3 was all about Actors. You learned about...

* Animation states
* Different ways of moving Actors
* Physics
* Controlling Actors with the keyboard & mouse
* Collisions and Groups
* Tweening and Effects as ways of adding visual flair

That's quite a lot to take in.

Now that you're familiar with these concepts, it's time to demonstrate your mastery of them by creating a game, with our help.


## Challenge: Create "Breakout"

"Breakout" is a fun, casual puzzle game that calls for quick reflexes. It uses physics, collisions, and special effects to entertain the player.

#### Your Task
Design a simple version of Breakout that includes these features:

Feature | Screenshot
--- | ---
A paddle the player can move in two directions. | ![paddle](https://static.stencyl.com/pedia2/ch3/challenge/5-0.png)
A bouncing ball you can launch from your paddle. | ![ball](https://static.stencyl.com/pedia2/ch3/challenge/7-0.png)
A short delay between ball launches. | ---
Blocks that change color and make a sound, when they collide with the ball. | ![breakout-screenshot-bouncing-ball](https://static.stencyl.com/pedia2/ch3/challenge/image11.png)

## Start with this Project
To help you get started, we've created a basic Kit with graphics, sounds, and a Scene to get you started and so you don't need to import any game resources. Just write the logic.

> **Instructions:** Import this using File > Import. Requires Stencyl 3.4.0 or later.


## Stuck? Want some hints?

* **Hint 1** - The ball shouldn't move the paddle when they collide. Look at each Actor Type's [Physics](https://www.stencyl.com/help/view/working-with-physics/) settings.

* **Hint 2** - You'll need a Behavior to keep your paddle from disappearing off screen.
