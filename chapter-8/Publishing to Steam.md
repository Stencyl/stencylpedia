## What is Steam ?

Steam is a digital game marketplace developed by Valve Corporation. Steam supports desktop games of Windows, Mac , and Linux. 

## How does it work ?

First you [pay $100 for Greenlight access](http://store.steampowered.com/app/219820/).  Then you can set up your Greenlight page.  
You'll need a trailer on Youtube, 4 screenshots, a description, and a 200x200 game icon (which can also be a GIF). 
You'll get visibility on Greenlight while your game is new and get a bunch of votes, but the actual amount depends on how attractive your icon and page are and also what percent of viewers vote yes.  
Within a few days if you're not one of the top games your votes will go down to about 0 and if you need more votes you'll have to get them on your own.  Steam has been reducing the number of required yes votes over time so unless your game is doing really badly it will most likely be Greenlit under a year even without extra promotion.  This Steam group keeps track of the age of Greenlight games.

## How difficult is it to get there from Stencyl?

Pretty easy. Stencyl's standard desktop export performance is solid. There's some setup needed on Steam, but its pretty simple after learning it.

> **Note:** Publishing desktop games is a paid feature. [Purchase a license](http://www.stencyl.com/pricing/) to access this functionality.

## Is worth it?

Very. But at the end of the day it depeneds on the quilty of your game. Similar to publishing on Google Play and the App Store.

## Is there any code that is needed to be integrate into Stencyl for Greenlight?

No, Greenlight is only for showing what your game looks like.  
Even after Greenlight you don't need to make changes to your game unless you want to support achievements or leaderboards which you can use [the Stencyl extension](http://community.stencyl.com/index.php/topic,47705.0.html) for.

## Once your game is accepted ( enough votes) are there any additional fees?

No. Your only required to pay once ( for the greenlit access).
