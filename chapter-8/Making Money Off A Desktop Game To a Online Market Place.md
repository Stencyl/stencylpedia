## Earning A Profit off Desktop Games

Generally, there are two ways to make profit off your hard worked desktop game. One way is to sell the game to a company. The other more 
common way is to bring your game or software to Online Market Place for games. There are dozens of site which offer this, the two main 
ones developers usually is the [Steam Store](store.steampowered.com), and [Itch.io](itch.io).


# What is Steam ?

Steam is a digital game marketplace developed by Valve Corporation. Steam supports desktop games of Windows, Mac , and Linux.

## How does it work ?

First you [pay $100 for Greenlight access](http://store.steampowered.com/app/219820/).  Then you can set up your Greenlight page.  
You'll need a trailer on Youtube, 4 screenshots, a description, and a 200x200 game icon (which can also be a GIF). 
You'll get visibility on Greenlight while your game is new and get a bunch of votes, but the actual amount depends on how attractive your icon and page are and also what percent of viewers vote yes.  
Within a few days if you're not one of the top games your votes will go down to about 0 and if you need more votes you'll have to get them on your own.  Steam has been reducing the number of required yes votes over time so unless your game is doing really badly it will most likely be Greenlit under a year even without extra promotion.  This Steam group keeps track of the age of Greenlight games.

## How difficult is it to get there from Stencyl?

Pretty easy. Stencyl's standard desktop export performance is solid. There's some setup needed on Steam, but its pretty simple after learning it.

> **Note:** Publishing desktop games is a paid feature. [Purchase a license](http://www.stencyl.com/pricing/) to access this functionality.

## Is worth it?

Very. But at the end of the day it depeneds on the quilty of your game. Similar to publishing on Google Play and the App Store.

## Is there any code that is needed to be integrate into Stencyl for Greenlight?

No, Greenlight is only for showing what your game looks like.  
Even after Greenlight you don't need to make changes to your game unless you want to support achievements or leaderboards which you can use [the Stencyl extension](http://community.stencyl.com/index.php/topic,47705.0.html) for.

## Once your game is accepted ( enough votes) are there any additional fees?

No. Your only required to pay once ( for the greenlit access).

For further information, please see the [Steam Greenlight FAQ](http://steamcommunity.com/workshop/about/?appid=765&section=faq)

> **Note:** Steam does however collect a percent off you games revenue.





# What is itch.io ?

Itch.io is a digital game marketplace developed originally developed by a coder Leaf Corcoran. Itch.io supports games of Windows, Mac , and Linux. It also supports HTML5 and Flash Games.

## How does it work ?

Very easy setup. Simply create a itch.io account and set your account to a dev account. Then you can set up your itch.io page.  
You could add videos, screentshot, rating options, and even set up a itch.io forum for your game! 
Itch.io collect nothing out of your pocket. It also doesn't collect any percent of your revenue. However, if you feel grateful to the developers, there is a option to set a renvue percent to go to itch.io developers if you wish.

## How difficult is it to get there from Stencyl?

Pretty easy. There's is no extra setup with Stencyl needed on Itch.io.

> **Note:** Publishing desktop games is a paid feature. [Purchase a license](http://www.stencyl.com/pricing/) to access this functionality.

## Is worth it?

As of writing, Stencyl devs had reported feedback based off their experience using itch.io that there hasn't been that much profit rolling in. 
Itch.io has many players but its not even comparable to Steam. But its 100% free and may be big one day, so there's nothing to lose.

# Which one should I go with?

Well its best to go with both so your getting both players. However if you don't want to have to maintain your game on two places, the choise is up to you. Here are the Pro's and Con's about both marketplaces.

Name|Pro|Cons|
---- | --- | --- | 
Steam|Large Community, you game will be noticed!| Costs, developers have to pay for Greenlit and some of the renvue is collected.|
Itch |100% Free|Small Community, not enough player. More advertising is needed.|

There you have it. So choose which ever one works. Go with Steam and the cost or go with Itch.io but be prepared to do some advertising.



## Summary:

* There are two main marketplaces for games which developers usually aim for the [Steam Store](store.steampowered.com), and [Itch.io](itch.io).
* Steam cost money to use but generates a lot of renvue, Itch.io is free but is still not as popular as Steam for where gamer shop.
