## Challenge: Create a "Mini-Dungeon"
## Action Adventure Game

Dungeons are the heart of an adventure game such as Zelda.
They blend both action and puzzle solving.

#### Your Task
Design your own mini-dungeon game that includes the following elements:

* Has an intro room with nothing except an entrance to the 1st main room
* At least 3 main rooms
* A final room that simply says "You Win!"
* Every main room has a locked door that prevents you from proceeding until you've satisfied the game's conditions.
* 1 room should involve stepping on a switch to open up the door
* 1 room should involve killing all enemies to open up the door
* 1 room should involve activating two switches. Both must be active to open the door.
* All of the main rooms should contain enemies.
* Background music should constantly play without restarting between rooms.
 
#### Here's a Head Start
To make this easy on you, we're providing a scaffold game to work from. That way you can focus on building your dungeon. This scaffold game contains the following:


Feature | Screenshot
--- | ---
A hero who can walk around and shoot energy blasts (use the Z key) | ![stencyl-hero-actor](https://static.stencyl.com/pedia2/ch4/challenge/image01.png)
Sounds, including sound effects and background music | ![stencyl-sound-icon](https://static.stencyl.com/pedia2/ch4/challenge/image18.png)
A basic enemy Actor who can walk around randomly | ![stencyl-slime-actor](https://static.stencyl.com/pedia2/ch4/challenge/image09.png)

Have fun with this challenge and make it your own. Good luck!
